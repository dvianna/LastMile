# LastMile

The notebook classifier.ipynb contains some attempts of feature engineering and classification using data from the 2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Research Challenge.

Codes and results from the team AIDA can be found at [LMRRC-Team-AIDA](https://github.com/fellipessanha/LMRRC-Team-AIDA). The team ranked 19th place in the competition applying machine learning to learn the cost function to be used by a variety of optimization heuristics, such as iterated local search and simulated annealing.
